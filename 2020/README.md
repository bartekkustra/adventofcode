# Advent of Code
www.adventofcode.com

> Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.
> 
> You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little programming knowledge and some problem solving skills will get you pretty far. Nor do you need a fancy computer; every problem has a solution that completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware.

# About the challenge
I'll be posting my solutions and approaches to solve tasks in Advent of Code. I'll do my best to differentiate between part 1 and part 2 (as each task consists of two parts), but I can't promise anything here ;) My main language used in solving that is going to be JavaScript, but I might use Python on some occasions.

My name is Bartosz, but people call me **Bart**. I'm a Senior QA and Software Engineer at Webflow. My main specialization is around tests automation, but I try to learn a bit of different programming languages when I can. In my past I've learned:
- PHP
- LUA
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- C++
- C#
- Python
- SQL

On top of that I've also learned HTML & CSS, but since I've found [Webflow](https://www.webflow.com) in 2013 I no longer had to write code to build websites.
