# Advent of Code
[www.adventofcode.com](https://adventofcode.com)

> Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.
> 
> You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little programming knowledge and some problem solving skills will get you pretty far. Nor do you need a fancy computer; every problem has a solution that completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware.

# About the challenge
I'll be posting my solutions and approaches to solve tasks in Advent of Code. I'll do my best to differentiate between part 1 and part 2 (as each task consists of two parts), but I can't promise anything here ;) My main language used in solving that is going to be TypeScript, but I might use Python on some occasions when node is just too slow...

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+
- npm

### Setup
```bash
npm install
```

### Create a new day
```bash
npm run new <year> <day>
# Example: npm run new 2025 1
```

### Run a day (with hot reload)
```bash
npm run day <year> <day>
# Example: npm run day 2025 1
```

### Run tests
```bash
npm run test:day <year> <day>
# Example: npm run test:day 2025 1
```

### Run all days in a year
```bash
npm run all <year>
# Example: npm run all 2025
```
